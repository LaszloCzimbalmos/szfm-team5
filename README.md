# University Website Project

This project is the implementation of a university website created for a university course. The website is designed using HTML, CSS (generated from SCSS), and JavaScript. The main objective of the project is to demonstrate the use of modern web technologies in building a responsive, user-friendly, and well-structured website.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key components:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the website, with separate pages for different sections (e.g., homepage, about, courses, contact, etc.).
- **CSS (generated from SCSS)**: Custom styles are written in SCSS to improve maintainability, which are then compiled into standard CSS. This allows for better organization and easier management of styles.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances the interactivity of the website, including form validation, dynamic content loading, and responsive features.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Navigation**: A simple and intuitive navigation menu with links to the main sections of the website.
- **SCSS for Styles**: SCSS is used to create clean and modular stylesheets, which are compiled into CSS for browser compatibility.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: JavaScript is used for various interactive features, such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and more.
